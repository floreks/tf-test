## Ansible

- Basic playbooks demonstrating simple tasks like pinging hosts and printing messages.
- Variable playbooks to define and reuse variables in Ansible tasks.

## Usage

1. Customize variables as needed in the variable files for Terraform and Ansible.
2. Run Terraform commands to deploy infrastructure.
3. Run Ansible playbooks to configure the deployed instances.

## Notes
