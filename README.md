# tf-test

## Project Overview

This repository contains infrastructure automation code using Ansible and Terraform.

## Directory Structure

### ansible/
- Contains Ansible playbooks and variable definitions.
- `basic/`: Basic Ansible playbooks for configuration management.
- `variables/`: Variable files used by the Ansible playbooks.

### terraform/
- Contains Terraform configurations for provisioning cloud infrastructure.
- `basic/`: Basic Terraform configurations.
- `google-compute-instance/`: Terraform configurations specifically for Google Compute Engine instances.
- `long/`: Possibly extended or more complex Terraform configurations.
- `variables/`: Variable definitions for Terraform configurations.

## Usage

- Use the Ansible playbooks in the `ansible/` directory to manage configuration of your infrastructure.
- Use the Terraform configurations in the `terraform/` directory to provision and manage cloud resources.

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed (Ansible, Terraform) and configured with appropriate credentials before running the playbooks or applying Terraform configurations.

## Notes

- This repository is organized to separate configuration management (Ansible) and infrastructure provisioning (Terraform).
- Customize variables in the respective `variables/` directories to suit your environment.
