# Infrastructure-as-Code Project: Terraform and Ansible

This repository contains infrastructure automation configurations and playbooks using Terraform and Ansible. It demonstrates various Terraform setups for provisioning cloud resources and Ansible playbooks for configuring and managing infrastructure components.

## Project Structure

### Terraform
- `terraform/basic/`: Basic Terraform configuration examples.
- `terraform/google-compute-instance/`: Terraform configuration for provisioning Google Compute Engine instances.
- `terraform/long/`: Extended Terraform configurations, potentially with more complex setups.
- `terraform/variables/`: Terraform variable definitions and configurations.

### Ansible
- `ansible/basic/main.yaml`: Basic Ansible playbook demonstrating configuration management.
- `ansible/variables/main.yaml`: Ansible playbook that uses variables for dynamic configuration.

## Usage

- Use Terraform configurations to provision and manage infrastructure components.
- Use Ansible playbooks to configure, deploy software, and manage the state of the provisioned infrastructure.

This project serves as an example and starting point for infrastructure automation using Terraform and Ansible.
