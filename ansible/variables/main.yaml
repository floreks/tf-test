# The "name" of the play is "Variables playbook tests".
- name: Variables playbook tests
  # The "hosts" directive specifies the hosts that the play will be run on.
  # In this case, it is "localhost".
  hosts: localhost
  # The "tasks" section contains a list of tasks that will be executed on the hosts.
  tasks:
    # The first task is to ping the hosts.
    - name: Ping my hosts
      # The "ansible.builtin.ping" module is used to ping the hosts.
      ansible.builtin.ping:
